\title{Convert objects and outputs from BIOMOD.xx into biomod2.xx
objects and outputs}
\usage{
BIOMOD_ConvertOldRun(savedObj, path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{savedObj}{a BIOMOD.1.xx workspace image. It's a .Rdata file
named 'Biomod_run.RData' for plurispecific run or 
Your_Species_Name.RData if you have done monospecific modelling}

\item{path}{Optional path to your 'savedObj' if you don't have give
the full path to the object}
}
\value{
A list of 'BIOMOD.models.out' (one per species modeled)
containing information of your old run. Specific directories are also
created on your hard drive (see \code{\link{BIOMOD_Modeling}})
}
\description{
This function converts workspace, modelling outputs, results and
objects created with version xx of \pkg{BIOMOD} into \pkg{biomod2}
objects and re-organized the directories to be used with \pkg{biomod2}
}
\details{
This function is useful to convert former \pkg{BIOMOD} runs into the
new \pkg{biomod2} object structure. This is mostly interesting in the
case users want to relaunched some projections or analyses within the
\pkg{biomod2} new structure. Returned 'BIOMOD.models.out' objects can
be then used as classic object for making projections for instance
(\code{\link{BIOMOD_Projection}}).

Be aware that because \pkg{biomod2} has strongly changed between the
first and second version, some new additional functions and 
information could not be used with converted objects (i.e. Calibration
Lines access, Maxent run, SRE projections...).
